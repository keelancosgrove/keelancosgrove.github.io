It's Christmas 2019. I'm sitting alone on a cramped chair, munching on a PBJ in my pajamas in the room I spent most of my adolescent years in. Time to start writing a blog!

Though I wasn't the best at it, I enjoyed writing throughout high school and college. It's concerning that my only experience writing English prose afterwards is through hastily drafted e-mails and technical design documents. Languages like C++ and Java are great for expressing ideas to computers, not people. I have no shortage of ideas. However, most remain mere shower thoughts, forgotten as soon as some urgent crisis arises, such as the need for coffee or a protein bar. So what better way to catalogue the state of my mind over time and hone my writing skills than this?

Perhaps one day some greater purpose will arise from these posts. It could be a prospective employer, or a like-minded person. Perhaps the information within could help or amuse someone. One day maybe I'll get good enough at this to write a book. I don't think very far ahead, so for now consider this a way to kill time.

I'd like to start with at least two posts a week. So this is the initial commit, reviewed and signed off by myself!
