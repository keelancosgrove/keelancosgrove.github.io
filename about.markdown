...Who am I? Well, to start:

* 24 years old, born in Toronto and lived most of my life in Connecticut. Now I'm in Seattle.
* Graduated in December 2016 from Cornell University with B.A. in computer science and mathematics. Now I'm a software engineer on the [QuickSight](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/) team within Amazon Web Services. QuickSight is a business intelligence service offering powerful, interactive visualizations on data. I work on the [SPICE engine](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/managing-spice-capacity.html), the back end responsible for making QuickSight quick.
* I run, lift, and dabble in rock climbing and salsa dancing.
* I read almost every day with the goal of 52 books a year. I'm a little short at approximately 40 in 2019. You can see what I've read and am planning to read in [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/97649247-keelan-cosgrove).
* I like peanut butter, cheap beer, potatoes, Dota2, and 90s hip hop/rap.
* I hate slow drivers, League of Legends, and keto diets.

Next time I have to write one of these, I'll just copy my Tinder bio.
