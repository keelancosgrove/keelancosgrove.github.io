Hi friends. I enjoy writing and sharing ideas, so here's a blog.

Who am I? Well, to start:

* I'm a software engineer profesionally. I like to move quickly and design systems that move even faster.
* I run, hike, lift, and dabble in rock climbing and salsa dancing.
* I read almost every day with the goal of 52 books a year. I'm a little short at approximately 40 in 2019. You can see what I've read and am planning to read in [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/97649247-keelan-cosgrove). People should never stop learning.
* I like peanut butter, cheap beer, potatoes, Dota2, and 90s hip hop/rap.

This blog is hosted by [GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages), and is statically generated using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll).
